This publication made use of SDSS-I/II data. Funding for the SDSS and SDSS-II was provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Participating Institutions, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Japanese Monbukagakusho, the Max Planck Society, and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The SDSS Web Site is \url{http://www.sdss.org/}.

This publication uses data generated via the Zooniverse.org platform, development of which is funded by generous support, including a Global Impact Award from Google, and by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. We would also like to thank the 2,340 volunteers who have submitted classifications to the \textit{Galaxy Builder} project, especially user EliabethB, whose presence on the \textit{Galaxy Builder} forum on top of a large number of galaxies modelled has been a huge help.

This project was partially funded by a Google Faculty Research Award to Karen Masters (\url{https://ai.google/research/outreach/faculty-research-awards/}), and Timothy Lingard acknowledges studentship funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (ST/N504245/1).
