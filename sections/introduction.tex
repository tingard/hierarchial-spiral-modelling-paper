Spiral structure is present in a majority of massive galaxies (\citealt{1989gadv.book..151B}, \citealt{2008MNRAS.389.1179L}) yet the formation mechanisms through which spiral structure originates are still hotly debated. Spirals are as diverse as the theories proposed to govern their evolution; from the quintessential pair of well-defined arcs of the grand design spiral, to the fragmented arm segments of the flocculent spiral, to the disjointed multi-armed spiral. These variatons on structure account for $18\%$, $50\%$ and $32\%$ of the population respectively (\citealt{2011ApJ...737...32E}, \citealt{2015yCat..22170032B}). Our current understanding of the mechanisms which drive spiral growth and evolution suggest that each of the different forms of spiral galaxy may be triggered primarily by different processes. Grand Design spirals are thought to have undergone a tidal interaction, be driven by a bar (as suggested by Manifold theory, \citealt{2011hsa6.conf..548R}), or be obeying quasi-stationary density wave theory (QSDW theory), in which spiral arms are slowly evolving, ever-present structures in the disc \citep{1964ApJ...140..646L}. Flocculent spirals are thought to be formed through swing amplification (shearing of small gravitational instabilities in the disc), and be transient and reccurent in nature \citep{1966ApJ...146..810J}. It is recognised that methods of spiral formation are not mutually exclusive. There is also debate as to the evolution of spiral structure: whether spirals maintain their shape over many rotational periods (assumed by QSDW theory, \citealt{1964ApJ...140..646L}), or ``wind up'' with the differential rotation of the disc (as found by \citealt{2019MNRAS.487.1808M}).

Arms of spiral galaxies are the source of the vast majority of star formation in the Universe, and spirals rearrange disc gas and can lead to the formation of disc-like bulges (e.g. \citealt{2004ARA&A..42..603K}). Studies of spiral morphology have found interesting correlations between spiral morphology and other galactic properties, such as a correlation between spiral tightness and central mass concentration (\citealt{2019ApJ...871..194Y}, \citealt{2015PhDT........14D}, though \citealt{2017MNRAS.472.2263H} found no such relation) and tightness and rotation curve shape (\citealt{2005MNRAS.359.1065S}, with rising rotation curves creating more open spiral structure). These predictions and observations provide compelling reasons for investigating their underlying rules and dynamics, as doing so is essential for understanding the secular evolution of disc galaxies.

\subsection{Measuring galaxy pitch angle}

Many methodologies have been proposed and implemented to measure spiral arm properties, including visual inspection (\citealt{2015A&A...582A..86H}), fourier analysis (i.e. \textsc{2DFFT}, \citealt{2012ApJS..199...33D}), texture analysis (i.e. SpArcFiRe, \citealt{2014ApJ...790...87D}), and combinations of automated methods and human classifiers \citep{2017MNRAS.472.2263H}. One potentially underused method of obtaining measurements of spirals is through photometric fitting of spiral structure, as possible using tools such as \textsc{GALFIT} \citep{2010AJ....139.2097P} and \textit{Galaxy Builder} (\comment{Lingard et al, in prep}). These methods attempt to localize light from an image of a galaxy into distinct subcomponents, such as a galaxy disc, bulge, bar and spiral arms, generally finding the optimum solution using computational optimization. This optimization process, however, is often not robust for complex, many-component models and requires significant supervision to converge to a physically meaningful result \citep{Gao2017:1709.00746v1}. \comment{Lingard et al, in prep} propose a solution to this problem through the use of citizen science to provide the starting points for computational fitting.

A common assumption when measuring galaxy pitch angle is that observed spiral arms have a constant pitch angle. Spirals of this kind are known as logarithmic spirals and are described by

\begin{equation}
r = A\,e^{\theta\tan\phi},
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the arm's pitch angle. One method used to obtain a pitch angle of a galaxy is to fit logarithmic spirals to individually identified arm segments and take the weighted mean of their pitch angles (which often vary by upwards of $10^\circ$, \citealt{2014ApJ...790...87D}). Weighting is determined by the length of the arc segment, with longer being assigned higher weights, i.e. for a galaxy where we have identified $N$ arm segments, each with length $L_i$ and pitch angle $\phi_i$

\begin{equation}
  \phi_\mathrm{gal} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_i\right)^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_i \phi_i.
\end{equation}

The most commonly used measurement of uncertainty of length-weighted pitch angles is the \comment{unweighted?} sample variance between the arm segments identified.

A notable drawback of length-weighted pitch angle is sensitivity to the number and quality of the spiral arm segments identified; \citet{2017MNRAS.472.2263H} found that only 15\% of the arm segments identified by a leading algorithm (\textsc{SpArcFiRe}) were identified as ``good'' matches to real spiral arms by citizen science classifiers.

Fourier analysis in one-dimension (as performed by \comment{...}) and two-dimensions (\comment{...}) is another widely used method of computationally obtaining galaxy pitch angles. Two-dimensional fourier methods generally decompose a deprojected image of a galaxy into a superpositions of logarithmic spirals between inner and outer annuli \citep{2012ApJS..199...33D}, and reports the pitch angle with the highest amplitude as the galaxy's pitch angle. It is uncertain how the large observed variation between pitch angles of individual arms impacts this measurement.

This paper makes use of the photometric models obtained through the \textit{Galaxy Builder} citizen science project for the 196 spiral galaxies present in \comment{Lingard et al, in prep}. In this paper we focus on the use of measured spiral tightness (quantified using pitch angle, \citealt{1987gady.book.....B}) as a probe into the dynamical mechanisms governing a spiral galaxy's evolution. We make use of Bayesian hierarchical modelling to measure galaxy pitch angle from the spiral arm clusters producted by \textit{Galaxy Builder}.

Section \ref{section:spiral_winding} investigates spiral arm winding using the test derived by \citealt{2019arXiv190910291P} (uniformity of galaxy pitch angle in $\cot\;\phi$) and concludes using a marginalized Anderson-Darling test that we \comment{cannot unilaterally reject winding of this form at the 1\% level}. Section \ref{section:morphology_comparision} examines the correlation between pitch angle and bulge size implied by the Hubble sequence and reported by \comment{citation}, and pitch angle and bar strength implied by Manifold theory, and find \comment{no significant correlation}.
